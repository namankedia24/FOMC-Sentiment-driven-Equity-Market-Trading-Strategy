1.8467960357666016,1,mr. lacker dissented because he believed that further tightening was needed to bring inflation down more rapidly than would be the case if the policy rate were kept unchanged.,,2006
3.3845880031585693,1,but members also cited the potential for persistently higher energy prices to affect longerrun inflation expectations and the possibility that taking into consideration recent declines in longterm interest rates financial conditions might not yet be tight enough to balance aggregate demand and potential supply in the face of optimism about the growth of labor and capital income in association with accelerating productivity.,,2000

2.7638189792633057,1,a more forceful policy move than the 25 basis point increases that had been implemented since mid1999 was desirable in light of the extraordinary and persisting strength of overall demand exceeding even the increasingly rapid growth of potential supply and the attendant indications of growing pressures in already tight markets for labor and other resources.,,2000

1.3192839622497559,1,however even these members saw considerable inflation risks should the slowdown in aggregate demand fail to be sustained and the members generally agreed that for the foreseeable future possible increases in underlying inflation remained the principal risk to the continued good performance of the u.s. economy.,,2000
1.2977678775787354,2,accordingly the committee incurred little risk in leaving the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting and waiting to see how the various factors affecting both supply and demand in the economy unfolded and influenced the prospects for economic activity and prices.,,2000

1.265131950378418,1,at the same time the incentive to take advantage of increasingly efficient hightech equipment and software typically available at declining prices would continue to provide an important underpinning for further large gains in investment spending with favorable implications for continued rapid growth in productivity.,,2000
2.1091039180755615,1,it was generally agreed that developments relating to energy would continue to exert upward pressure on prices over the near term including the passthrough or indirect effects of higher oil prices on core measures of inflation.,,2000

2.00673508644104,0,office construction appeared to be leveling off in response to the higher cost of financing and to perceptions that the office space currently coming on line would be sufficient to meet demand.,,2000
2.693267822265625,0,the deceleration in the economy had occurred from an unsustainably high growth rate in the first half of the year and the resulting containment in demand pressures on resources already had improved the outlook for inflation.,,2000
2.1767399311065674,2,the drop in private employment following very large gains in march and april seemed in the absence of other signs of weakening labor demand to be attributable at least to some extent to statistical noise and seasonal adjustment problems.,,2000

2.5919010639190674,2,while recognizing that growth was slowing more than had been anticipated and that developments might be moving in a direction that would require a shift to a balanced risk statement members agreed that such a change would be premature.,,2000

1.7227790355682373,1,at the same time many members emphasized that the committee needed to be prepared to act promptly should inflationary pressures appear to be intensifying and in the committees discussion of the balanceofrisks sentence to be included in the press statement that would be issued after this meeting all the members agreed that the sentence should continue to indicate that the risks to the economy remained weighted toward higher inflation in the foreseeable future.,,2000
2.2664647102355957,1,the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the eventual disappearance of positive wealth effects associated with outsized earlier gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates.,,2000
1.9746429920196533,1,the expansion of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with earlier large gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates.,,2000

2.3910529613494873,2,on the positive side continuing gains in consumer incomes and a high level of consumer confidence could be expected to foster sustained growth in such spending albeit probably at a pace below recent trends.,,2000
1.826902151107788,2,in the latter regard several members mentioned anecdotal evidence of growing export demand for a variety of domestic products.,,2000
2.308123826980591,2,nevertheless the drop in interest rates on fixedrate mortgages since midmay might have sparked the slight increase on balance in singlefamily housing starts in august and september and the upturn in new home sales in the third quarter.,,2000
0.4426898956298828,2,the committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.,,2000

1.5392510890960693,1,the members agreed that the press statement to be issued shortly after this meeting should continue to highlight their view that even after todays tightening move the risks would remain tilted toward heightened inflation pressures.,,2000
2.661931037902832,1,a lower dollar would tend to have a favorable effect on the trade deficit but also would add to inflationary pressures in the domestic economy.,,2000
1.4378249645233154,0,consumer spending appeared to be decelerating noticeably further in the fourth quarter in an environment of diminished consumer confidence smaller job gains and lower stock prices.,,2000
2.1405088901519775,1,on balance however the members saw a mild upward trend in key measures of inflation as a distinct possibility albeit one that was subject to considerable uncertainty.,,2000
1.943701982498169,0,the statistical evidence reviewed by the committee which was supported by widespread anecdotal reports pointed to a noticeable slowing in the expansion of demand and economic activity.,,2000

1.643657922744751,0,nonetheless the breadth of the expansion was seen as providing considerable assurance of its sustainability and committee members generally expected that accommodative monetary policy favorable financial market conditions and at least in the near term fiscal stimulus would continue to foster a pace of output growth that exceeded that of its potential.,,2004
1.5843968391418457,2,the rise in mortgage rates was not likely to show through to demand for housing until the second half of 2004 and was expected to be partially offset in the longer term by rising employment and personal income.,,2004
1.3223140239715576,2,residential construction activity remained at a high level evidently supported in part by recent declines in mortgage interest rates.,,2004

1.9402248859405518,1,given the current quite low level of shortterm rates especially when judged against the recent level of inflation members noted that significant cumulative policy tightening likely would be needed to foster conditions consistent with the committees objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth.,,2004
1.6525909900665283,1,in addition improving labor market conditions and the effects of strong productivity growth on permanent income were projected to support household spending while business investment spending was seen as strengthening in response to the acceleration in business output swelling profits and continued favorable financing conditions.,,2004

2.87333083152771,0,despite the substantial easing in the stance of monetary policy the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to an extent by some of the developments in financial marketsin particular the decline in household net worth associated with the earlier downturn in equity prices the continuation of relatively stringent terms and conditions on some types of loans by financial institutions and the appreciation of the dollar.,,2001
1.7392919063568115,0,in addition to the effects of lower market interest rates extensive mortgage financing activity and a flight to safety from volatile equity markets likely added to m2s strong upward trend.,,2001

1.4362030029296875,0,growth of consumer spending seemed to have slowed in the second quarter reflecting the deceleration in personal income the rise in unemployment and the earlier decline in household net worth.,,2001
1.561126947402954,0,reinforcing this outlook was recent evidence of somewhat faster than anticipated productivity growth the prospect that world economic conditions would hold down energy prices and a sharp drop in nearterm inflation expectations of households as reported in recent surveys.,,2001

1.9678230285644531,2,in the absence of renewed weakness in overall final demand which could not be ruled out given current consumer and business confidence production would need to pick up at some point to accommodate ongoing final demand.,,2001
1.5334811210632324,0,labor pressures on business costs might persist for a time in lagged response to earlier advances in headline consumer price inflation and labor productivity but their effects would tend to diminish or to be offset over time if in line with the members forecasts pressures on labor resources continued to ease.,,2001

1.7703278064727783,0,this view was premised in large measure on the lagged effects of the committees relatively aggressive easing actions this year including any further easing that might be adopted at this meeting growing prospects of some fiscal policy stimulus later in the year and more generally the favorable effects of still substantial productivity gains on profit opportunities and income growth and hence on business and household demands for goods and services.,,2001
1.4123692512512207,2,housing demand had remained at a relatively elevated level across much of the nation though signs of some softening were apparent prior to september 11 especially in the highpriced segment of the housing market.,,2001

1.3502342700958252,1,in this regard the risks of rising inflation could not be dismissed and while those risks appeared to be quite limited for the nearer term excessive monetary stimulus had to be avoided to avert rising inflation expectations and added inflation pressures over time.,,2001

1.3316092491149902,1,some also were concerned that the more sizable action in combination with an announcement of the committees continuing concern about further economic weakness would lead markets to build in inappropriate expectations of even more monetary stimulus.,,2001
1.7005901336669922,2,housing activity remained at a high level as attractive mortgage interest rates evidently continued to counterbalance the negative effects on consumer attitudes of somewhat weaker labor markets and reduced stock market wealth.,,2001

1.1298081874847412,0,in the view of most members however the weakness of the recent information relating to the performance of the economy was consistent with unbalanced risks at least insofar as it pertained to the outlook for the rest of this year and their primary policy concern at this point remained the strength of economic activity rather than potentially worsening inflation over the longer term.,,2001
2.7125792503356934,2,in their comments about developments in key sectors of the economy members noted that overall business activity had been supported at least to this point by the relative strength of household demand.,,2001
1.3483662605285645,2,on balance while the external risks to the u.s. economy clearly were to the downside at least over the nearer term the prospective rebound in u.s. economic activity and stimulative macroeconomic policies abroad were expected to contribute to strengthening growth worldwide and to improving prospects for exports during the year ahead.,,2001
1.2451210021972656,2,members referred in particular to the persisting strength in demand for light motor vehicles which evidently was boosted by continuing sales incentives and attractive financing terms.,,2001

1.6267547607421875,0,while the risks of weaker economic growth still tended to dominate those of rising inflation and called for some further easing the committee had added significant liquidity to the economy this year through its cumulatively large easing actions.,,2001
1.744807243347168,2,the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would extend its decline for a time in 2002 but then would begin to turn upward.,,2001
1.4979431629180908,0,with regard to the outlook for inflation members reported on widespread indications of some slackening in what were still generally tight labor markets and also noted that capacity utilization rates had declined substantially in many industries.,,2001
1.2025501728057861,1,the forecasts were concentrated in ranges of 4 to 5 percent for the growth in nominal gdp and 2 to 212 percent for the expansion in real gdp implying some strengthening of economic activity as the year progressed.,,2001

2.1333749294281006,0,factors underlying that assessment included the emergence of less taut conditions in labor markets relatively low capacity utilization rates in manufacturing and the persistence of highly competitive conditions in most product markets that made it very difficult for business firms to preserve or increase their profit margins by raising prices.,,2001
1.8516478538513184,1,in contrast to the declines in shortterm rates longerterm yields rose on balance as investors apparently became more confident of a pickup in output growth supported in part by improved prospects for substantial federal tax reductions.,,2001

1.8541560173034668,2,like consumer spending new home construction and sales had displayed considerable resilience in recent months apparently in large part as a result of relatively attractive mortgage interest rates and perhaps to some extent as a consequence of favorable weather conditions in many parts of the country.,,2001
1.2911019325256348,0,the core personal consumption expenditure pce chaintype price index presented a similar picture with inflation in april and may a little lower than earlier in the year and no change in inflation on a yearoveryear basis.,,2001

2.5546531677246094,2,indeed very recent information seemed to signal sudden further weakness but it was largely anecdotal and most of the aggregate data on spending and employment suggested continued economic expansion albeit at a relatively slow rate.,,2001
1.6355981826782227,0,the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the decline in household net worth associated with the downturn that had occurred in equity prices the remaining effects of prior monetary restraint and the continuation of somewhat stringent credit terms and conditions on some types of loans by financial institutions.,,2001

3.555407762527466,0,in the household sector an appreciable decline in sales of motor vehicles and slower growth in other consumer spending in the first quarter appeared to reflect concerns relating to the iraqi war and adverse weather conditions in some parts of the country.,,2003
3.2766551971435547,0,real gdp growth in the major foreign industrial countries remained weak in the first quarter as external demand sagged amid heightened geopolitical uncertainties.,,2003

3.1738851070404053,2,the successful prosecution of the war had served to reduce geopolitical uncertainties and in turn had helped to foster a marked strengthening of domestic financial markets a sizable decline in oil prices and an apparent upturn in consumer confidence.,,2003
2.281073808670044,0,at the same time maintaining an accommodative policy stance was seen as involving little risk of inducing rising inflation so long as high levels of excess capacity and very competitive markets continued to characterize economic conditions.,,2003

3.3672609329223633,2,although the appreciable upturn in those rates since midyear appeared to have slowed mortgage refinancing activity at least in some areas housing demand had remained buoyant perhaps in part because many homebuyers were attempting to lock in mortgage financing while rates were still low in relation to historical norms.,,2003
